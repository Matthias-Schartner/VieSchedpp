## Please follow the following style guide:

- put everything in namespace `VieVS`
- push your changes to git
- function names should start with a lowercase letter
- if a function name contains multiple words start every word with an uppercase letter
- use appropriate function / variable names (do not be afraid to use long names)
- class names should start with an uppercase letter
- if a class name contains multiple words start every word with an uppercase letter
- use doxygen style comments in your header files
- add units to your doxygen style comments in @param and @return block
- add comments where appropriate
- have a look at the source code to get a feeling about the style
- do not add `using namespace std` in a header file
- try to avoid heavy third party libraries 
- and most important: keep the code as simple and readable as possible
